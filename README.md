# my-first-web-map
  I used a dataset of Minority Banks and Community Development Financial Institution Banks from FDIC.gov,
 exported it to a CSV, converted it to JSON, and used it to create markers on a map.

 Given the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, many people have been taking out their deposits from regional banks and moving them into large banks like Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase. However, Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions are mission driven banks that serve minority and low-income populations that have less risky investments and do not present undue risk to the banking system. Therefore, I think that these institutions should be considered when deciding to where to keep your deposits. So, I wanted to create a map that showed the number and locations of MDIs and CDFIs in New York City to show people the many options they have to bank with these insitutions.
